# optik-warehouse
developed under the specific requierements of a small eyewear supplier

the code is //hard to read bc its the second program i have done so far. \n
took me around 3 working weeks 8 hrs/day \n
i knew it upside.down

hidden double clicks on the 2 main tables for more functions

some of the code its not used bc of requirement changes during the development

not the best thing to use in your shop. \n here only for the code as an example
